# Git File Groups (for VSCode)

Bundle changed files in a tree view of your own named groups as a lightweight mechanism for organizing work in progress.

This isn't intended to be used for industrial grade project work where pull-requests and branches are the obvious choices.

## Features

- Sits as an additional panel in the Source Control view alongside Changes, Branches, etc
- Groups can be created, renamed, deleted and files drag/dropped
- File Diff and File Open just like main 'Changes' panel
- Commit a group - stages ONLY the group files and initiates commit flow.
