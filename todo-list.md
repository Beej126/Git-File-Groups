- see how to tie groups to azdo work item#'s more directly so you can hyperlink to them by clicking on group header... there is an "open commit on remote" under source control > branches which does something similar
- groups need to be project specific, duh
- add file (count) to the right of the group title
- refresh after commit
- delete group
- allow drag/drop to land anywhere in group/files, not just group header
- see if there's an easy way to bring in new files without hitting refresh, which honestly is easy enough
